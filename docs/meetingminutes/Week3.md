**Meeting Agenda:**

The purpose of this meeting is to initially discuss the technology stack that may be used for the subsequent development of the project.

**Meeting Minutes:**

1. **Backend Technology**

- The team favors **Spring Boot** for the backend framework
- **Action Item**: Confirm via the **ED discussion board** whether the use of Spring Boot is permitted within the course requirements.

2. **Frontend Technology**
